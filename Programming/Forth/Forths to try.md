The normal dev cycle of build, burn, not work, tweak, build, burn, repeat is quite slow and annoying. It was kind of revolutionary for me to discover Mecrisp[0], which demonstrates how can provide a (fast!) language that also provides a friggin' repl into your hardware.<br><br>The ##forth IRC channel on Libera is quite active. Would recommend popping in for anyone interested. The two projects that got me interested in Forth are<br><br>1. JonesForth: [http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=blob;f=jonesforth...](http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=blob;f=jonesforth.S;hb=HEAD)<br><br>Explanation and motivation for the What and Why of Forth and its implementation. Well, actually, it's actually an implementation in x86 assembly, but the comments are a wonderful exposition and intro into Forth.<br><br>2. SmithForth: [https://dacvs.neocities.org/SF/](https://dacvs.neocities.org/SF/)<br><br>Implementation of Forth in x86-64 _opcodes_. It's a hand-written ELF that implements a Forth. It's simplicity is absolutely beautiful.<br><br>SmithForth is what pushed me over the edge to really start learning x86 assembly and Forth. I started by hand-decompiling the SmithForth binary, which was quite an adventure on its own.<br><br>[0]:[https://mecrisp.sourceforge.net/](https://mecrisp.sourceforge.net/)|
